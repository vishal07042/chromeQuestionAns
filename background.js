We haven't defined the variable yet on the line where we try to log the `name` variable, so it still holds the value of `undefined`.\n\nVariables with the `let` keyword (and `const`) are hoisted, but unlike `var`, don't get _initialized_. They are not accessible before the line we declare (initialize) them. This is called the \"temporal dead zone\". When we try to access the variables before they are declared, JavaScript throws a `ReferenceError`.",

By the time the `setTimeout` callback function was invoked, `i` was equal to `3` in the first example.\n\nIn the second loop, the variable `i` was declared using the `let` keyword: variables declared with the `let` (and `const`) keyword are block-scoped (a block is anything between `{ }`).

Even though we might not _type_ them as strings, they are always converted into strings under the hood.\n\nJavaScript interprets (or unboxes) statements. When we use bracket notation, it sees the first opening bracket `[` and keeps going until it finds the closing bracket `]`. Only then, it will evaluate the statement.\n\n`mouse[bird.size]`: First it evaluates `bird.size`, which is `"small"`. `mouse["small"]` returns `true`\n\nHowever, with dot notation, this doesn\'t happen. `mouse` does not have a key called `bird`, which means that `mouse.bird` is `undefined`. Then, we ask for the `size` using dot notation: `mouse.bird.size`. Since `mouse.bird` is `undefined`, we\'re actually asking `undefined.size`. This isn\'t valid, and will throw an error similar to `Cannot read property "size" of undefined`.',

The `WebAPI` gives us the `setTimeout` function to start with, and for example the DOM.\n\nAfter the _callback_ is pushed to the WebAPI, the `setTimeout` function itself (but not the callback!) is popped off the stack.\n\n[![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/3fb6829734d4f143e7b0e65777fb0fa797477b1099d5bf80dfff487dbf8d58ea/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f58357773484f672e706e67)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/3fb6829734d4f143e7b0e65777fb0fa797477b1099d5bf80dfff487dbf8d58ea/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f58357773484f672e706e67)\n\nNow, `foo` gets invoked, and `"First"` is being logged.\n\n[![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/67039fb1a1de6555795f4a4d935902970273a9ecedbd4db0d704c890d4cc104d/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f507663306447712e706e67)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/67039fb1a1de6555795f4a4d935902970273a9ecedbd4db0d704c890d4cc104d/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f507663306447712e706e67)\n\n`foo` is popped off the stack, and `baz` gets invoked. `"Third"` gets logged.\n\n[![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/3cc29283d12de4212d526a805190866349c3db20bf4b51e1fae5f08e318bad16/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f576841326243502e706e67)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/3cc29283d12de4212d526a805190866349c3db20bf4b51e1fae5f08e318bad16/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f576841326243502e706e67)\n\nThe WebAPI can\'t just add stuff to the stack whenever it\'s ready.

This is because when you try to access a property or method on a primitive like a string, JavaScript will implicitly wrap the primitive type using one of the wrapper classes, i.e. `String`, and then immediately discard the wrapper after the expression evaluates.

However, a generator function can be "stopped" midway, and later continue from where it stopped. Every time a generator function encounters a `yield` keyword, the function yields the value specified after it. Note that the generator function in that case doesn’t _return_ the value, it _yields_ the value.\n\nFirst, we initialize the generator function with `i` equal to `10`. We invoke the generator function using the `next()` method. The first time we invoke the generator function, `i` is equal to `10`. It encounters the first `yield` keyword: it yields the value of `i`. The generator is now "paused", and `10` gets logged.\n\nThen, we invoke the function again with the `next()` method. It starts to continue where it stopped previously, still with `i` equal to `10`. Now, it encounters the next `yield` keyword, and yields `i * 2`. `i` is equal to `10`, so it returns `10 * 2`, which is `20`. This results in `10, 20`.',

When we pass arguments by value, a _copy_ of that value is created (see question 46).\n\nThe variable `birthYear` has a reference to the value `"1997"`. The argument `year` also has a reference to the value `"1997"`, but it\'s not the same value as `birthYear` has a reference to. When we update the value of `year` by setting `year` equal to `"1998"`, we are only updating the value of `year`. `birthYear` is still equal to `"1997"`.\n\nThe value of `person` is an object. The argument `member` has a (copied) reference to the _same_ object. When we modify a property of the object `member` has a reference to, the value of `person` will also be modified, since they both have a reference to the same object. `person`\'s `name` property is now equal to the value `"Lydia"`',

When we add a property to an object using the `defineProperty` method, they are by default _not enumerable_. The `Object.keys` method returns all _enumerable_ property names from an object, in this case only `"name"`.\n\nProperties added using the `defineProperty` method are immutable by default. You can override this behavior using the `writable`, `configurable` and `enumerable` properties. This way, the `defineProperty` method gives you a lot more control over the properties you\'re adding to an object.',

The replacer can either be a function or an array, and lets you control what and how the values should be stringified.\n\nIf the replacer is an _array_, only the property names included in the array will be added to the JSON string.

The value of the parameter will be the default value, if no other value has been passed to the function, or if the value of the parameter is `"undefined"`. In this case, we spread the properties of the `value` object into a new object, so `x` has the default value of `{ number: 10 }`.\n\nThe default argument is evaluated at _call time_! Every time we call the function, a _new_ object is created. We invoke the `multiply` function the first two times without passing a value: `x` has the default value of `{ number: 10 }`. We then log the multiplied value of that number, which is `20`.\n\nThe third time we invoke multiply, we do pass an argument: the object called `value`. The `*=` operator is actually shorthand for `x.number = x.number * 2`: we modify the value of `x.number`, and log the multiplied value `20`.\n\nThe fourth time, we pass the `value` object again. `x.number` was previously modified to `20`, so `x.number *= 2` logs `40`.',

In this example, the code is running inside _global scope_ and there is no user defined local variable for `name`, therefore it searches the predefined _variables/properties_ in the global scope which is in case of browsers, it searches through `window` object and it will extract the [window.name](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/name) value which is equal to an **empty string**.\n    \n*   In **NodeJS**, there is no such property on the `global` object, thus attempting to access a non-existent variable will raise a [ReferenceError](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Errors/Not_defined).",

		answer: "#### [](#answer-c-23)Answer: C\n\nThe `add` function is a _memoized_ function. With memoization, we can cache the results of a function in order to speed up its execution. In this case, we create a `cache` object that stores the previously returned values.\n\nIf we call the `addFunction` function again with the same argument, it first checks whether it has already gotten that value in its cache. If that's the case, the caches value will be returned, which saves on execution time. Else, if it's not cached, it will calculate the value and store it afterwards.\n\nWe call the `addFunction` function three times with the same value: on the first invocation, the value of the function when `num` is equal to `10` isn't cached yet. The condition of the if-statement `num in cache` returns `false`, and the else block gets executed: `Calculated! 20` gets logged, and the value of the result gets added to the cache object. `cache` now looks like `{ 10: 20 }`.\n\nThe second time, the `cache` object contains the value that gets returned for `10`. The condition of the if-statement `num in cache` returns `true`, and `'From cache! 20'` gets logged.\n\nThe third time, we pass `5 * 2` to the function which gets evaluated to `10`. The `cache` object contains the value that gets returned for `10`. The condition of the if-statement `num in cache` returns `true`, and `'From cache! 20'` gets logged.",

		answer: '#### [](#answer-b-21)Answer: B\n\nThe value of the `this` keyword is dependent on where you use it. In a **method**, like the `getStatus` method, the `this` keyword refers to _the object that the method belongs to_. The method belongs to the `data` object, so `this` refers to the `data` object. When we log `this.status`, the `status` property on the `data` object gets logged, which is `"🥑"`.\n\nWith the `call` method, we can change the object to which the `this` keyword refers. In **functions**, the `this` keyword refers to the _the object that the function belongs to_. We declared the `setTimeout` function on the _global object_, so within the `setTimeout` function, the `this` keyword refers to the _global object_. On the global object, there is a variable called _status_ with the value of `"😎"`. When logging `this.status`, `"😎"` gets logged.',

A statement can for example be variables, or keywords like `throw`, `return`, `break`, etc.\n\nHere, we wrote a `return` statement, and another value `a + b` on a _new line_. However, since it's a new line, the engine doesn't know that it's actually the value that we wanted to return. Instead, it automatically added a semicolon after `return`. You could see this as:\n\nreturn;\na + b;\n\nThis means that `a + b` is never reached, since a function stops running after the `return` keyword. If no value gets returned, like here, the function returns `undefined`. Note that there is no automatic insertion after `if/else` statements!",

You could see this as:\n\n`[x, ...y] = [1, 2, 3, 4]`\n\nWith the rest parameter `...y`, we put all "remaining" arguments in an array. The remaining arguments are `2`, `3` and `4` in this case. The value of `y` is an array, containing all the rest parameters. The value of `x` is equal to `1` in this case, so when we log `[x, y]`, `[1, [2, 3, 4]]` gets logged.\n\nThe `getUser` function receives an object. With arrow functions, we don\'t _have_ to write curly brackets if we just return one value. However, if you want to instantly return an _object_ from an arrow function, you have to write it between parentheses, otherwise everything between the two braces will be interpreted as a block statement. In this case the code between the braces is not a valid JavaScript code, so a `SyntaxError` gets thrown.\n\nThe following function would have returned an object:\n\n`const getUser = user => ({ name: user.name, age: user.age })`',

The `getName` function first looks within its own context (scope) to see if it contains the variable `name` we're trying to access. In this case, the `getName` function contains its own `name` variable: we declare the variable `name` with the `let` keyword, and with the value of `'Sarah'`.\n\nVariables with the `let` keyword (and `const`) are hoisted, but unlike `var`, don't get _initialized_. They are not accessible before the line we declare (initialize) them. This is called the \"temporal dead zone\". When we try to access the variables before they are declared, JavaScript throws a `ReferenceError`.\n\nIf we wouldn't have declared the `name` variable within the `getName` function, the javascript engine would've looked down the _scope chain_. The outer scope has a variable called `name` with the value of `Lydia`. In that case, it would've logged `Lydia`.\n\nlet name \\= 'Lydia';\n\nfunction getName() {\n  console.log(name);\n}\n\ngetName(); // Lydia",

As long as there is a reference, the object won't get garbage collected. Since this is an interval, setting `config` to `null` or `delete`\\-ing `config.alert` won't garbage-collect the interval, so the interval will still be called. It should be cleared with `clearInterval(config.alert)` to remove it from memory. Since it was not cleared, the `setInterval` callback function will still get invoked every 1000ms (1s).",

(see my article on the event loop [here](https://dev.to/lydiahallie/javascript-visualized-event-loop-3dif).)\n\nThen we call the `myPromise` promise, which is an _asynchronous_ operation.\n\nBoth the promise and the timeout are asynchronous operations, the function keeps on running while it's busy completing the promise and handling the `setTimeout` callback. This means that `Last line 1!` gets logged first, since this is not an asynchonous operation.\n\nSince the callstack is not empty yet, the `setTimeout` function and promise in `funcOne` cannot get added to the callstack yet.\n\nIn `funcTwo`, the variable `res` gets `Promise` because `Promise.resolve(Promise.resolve('Promise'))` is equivalent to `Promise.resolve('Promise')` since resolving a promise just resolves it's value. The `await` in this line stops the execution of the function until it receives the resolution of the promise and then keeps on running synchronously until completion, so `Promise 2!` and then `Last line 2!` are logged and the `setTimeout` is sent to the Web API.\n\nThen the call stack is empty. Promises are _microtasks_ so they are resolved first when the call stack is empty so `Promise 1!` gets to be logged.\n\nNow, since `funcTwo` popped off the call stack, the call stack is empty. The callbacks waiting in the queue (`() => console.log(\"Timeout 1!\")` from `funcOne`, and `() => console.log(\"Timeout 2!\")` from `funcTwo`) get added to the call stack one by one. The first callback logs `Timeout 1!`, and gets popped off the stack. Then, the second callback logs `Timeout 2!`, and gets popped off the stack.",

In this case, we pass the `handler` object which contained two properties: `set` and `get`. `set` gets invoked whenever we _set_ property values, `get` gets invoked whenever we _get_ (access) property values.\n\nThe first argument is an empty object `{}`, which is the value of `person`. To this object, the custom behavior specified in the `handler` object gets added. If we add a property to the `person` object, `set` will get invoked. If we access a property on the `person` object, `get` gets invoked.\n\nFirst, we added a new property `name` to the proxy object (`person.name = "Lydia"`). `set` gets invoked, and logs `"Added a new property!"`.\n\nThen, we access a property value on the proxy object, the `get` property on the handler object got invoked. `"Accessed a property!"` gets logged.',

The fruit array now consists of `['🍇', '🍊', '🍎']`.",

We’re catching the rejected value in the chained `catch` method on the `runPromises` invocation to catch any errors within the `runPromises` function.

The first element in each subarray will be the key, and the second element in each subarray will be the value. In this case, we’re mapping over the `keys` array, which returns an array which first element is the item on the key array on the current index, and the second element is the item of the values array on the current index.\n\nThis creates an array of subarrays containing the correct keys and values, which results in `{ name: "Lydia", age: 22 }`',

The `!` operator converts the value to a boolean value. If the value is truthy, the returned value will be `false`, if the value is falsy, the returned value will be `true`.

Since the condition returned `false`, the code block of the `else` statement gets run, and `Yay it\'s a string!` gets logged.',
